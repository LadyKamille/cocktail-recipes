`yarn eject`
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

## Running the application
Run `python manage.py runserver` and `yarn start` to start the development server.
The frontend will likely start on http://localhost:3000 and the api on http://localhost:8000.
You can interact directly with the API in the browser at http://localhost:8000/api/,
or use Insomnia/Postman.
